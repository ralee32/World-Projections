    <h1>GEOG370 Map Projections</h1>
    
    <h4>I used the Indicatrix Mapper plugin to create a Tissotâ€™s Indicatrix in QGIS. The indicatrix visualizes the distortion of various map projections, which is represented by a vector file of circles and gridlines over a basemap of the continents. I then used class notes and information made available by esri.com for details on each of the projections.</h4>

    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    
    <h5>The WGS84 projection is the standard reference system used in mainstream GIS software. It is  commonly found in applications such as GPS, Google Earth, etc. This projection distorts the distance and area of continents, but generally preserves the direction and shape.</h5>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    
    <h5>The Aitoff projection is a modified azimuthal projection that is often used in small-scale mapping. This projection distorts shape, area, distance, direction, and angle. </h5>

    <h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    
    <h5>The Pseudo-Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection used by Google Maps and many other web mapping applications. Along with WGS84, Pseudo-Mercator is one of the most commonly used projections in mapping. It distorts distance and area, while preserving direction and shape.</h5>

    <h2>Sphere Winkel I Projection</h2>
    
    <h5>The Sphere Winkel I projection is a pseudocylindrical projection that is often used for world maps. It distorts shape, area, direction, and distance.</h5>

    <h2>World Cylindrical Equal Area Projection</h2>
    
    <h5>The World Cylindrical Equal Area projection is, as its name suggests, a cylindrical projection that preserves area along the standard parallels, but it distorts shape, direction, angle, and distance. It is commonly used for large-scale mapping of areas surrounding the equator.</h5>

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    
    <h5>The World Equidistant Conic projection is, as its name suggests, a conic projection that preserves distance along the standard parallels, but generally distorts shape, area, direction, and angles.</h5>

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    
    <h5>The North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant projection is an azimuthal projection that accurately preserves distance and direction from the center point, but distorts shape and area. This projection is often used in displays of polar regions.</h5>

    <h2>Bonne Projection</h2>
    
    <h5>The Bonne projection is an equal-area pseudoconic map projection that was frequently used to map continents. It distorts shape, direction, angles, and distances, but the scale remains accurate along the standard parallels. It was typically used during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries for large-scale mapping.</h5>

    <h2>Eckert I Projection</h2>
    
    <h5>The Eckert I projection is a pseudocylindrical projection that distorts shape, area, distance, direction, and angles. For this reason, it does not have any real practical use and was never widely used.</h5>
